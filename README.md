This code uses the USB/IP project: http://usbip.sourceforge.net/ to emulate usb devices. <br>
In this example I showed how to emulate HID mouse device. <br>
This code can be easily changed to support any usb device. <br>
This code is very experimental, use with care. <br>
In the HID example there is a bug with USB/IP driver that causes blue screen on de-attach: <br>

It doesnt happen with other devices I tested. <br>
